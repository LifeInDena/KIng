        <p>Originally from Lee co Ky, Taylor Spicer was raised like any other girl from Eastern Kentucky. She was raised with a big family, and big dreams. At age 5, she moved to Nicholasville Kentucky, where she attended school and lived into her adult life. At 22 years old, she is a single mother of two beautiful girls and is a local karaoke performer around her city, trying to fulfill her dreams.

            Growing up with a large family, She has many open doors into the music industry. Her Uncle is the Vice President of Mercury Records in Nashville Tennessee. She was given the opportunity to meet and been inspired by many country artists such as Terry Clark, Gretchen Wilson, Julia Roberts, Billy Currington, Julianne Hough, Easton Corbin.. ect..
            Taylor has been preforming at her home town Wooly Worm festival, as well as several others around the state. In 2017, she auditioned for the Voice, making it to the final round before airing on television and was told to come back next year. She will be returning for auditions late 2019.
            
            Her drive and ambition to make a better life for herself and her children is impeccable, and she says “Growing up I had no idea where I’d end up. AlI I knew was music was the only thing that filled my soul. When I sang I drew a crowd, and I knew one day, I was gonna make it! If not for me, I’ll make it for someone else.”
            
            During Taylor’s journey as pursuing a career as an up and coming artist, her grandmother and her father have been her biggest support system when It came to her talent. Family is the biggest part of what will make her a star.
